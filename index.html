Whenever I'm feeling down in the dumps, anything <em>cute</em> always makes me happy! This website is made of pure HTML-cuteness!
Looking at cute pictures is not only only a way to increase happiness, but is also a good way to relieve stress.

        This is my cousin, Brooks, on Halloween. He's very cute! In recent years, the purpose of the Internet has swayed from scientific use to basically posting pictures of cute animals (literally and metaphorically). This theory, called "The Cute Cat Theory", is summarized by Ethan Zuckerman on his website.
